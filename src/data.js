      'Sometimes dogs are sick after taking tablets or medication, and we often recommend administering with a little food to reduce the chance of this happening. If your dog is sick immediately afterwards, it is probable that the worming treatment will not have been absorbed into the dog's system, and will need to be repeated in a couple of days time when its tummy has settled again. If this happens, provide fresh drinking water and keep and eye on the animal to ensure its condition does not deteriorate. If vomiting persists or your pet seems to be in distress, we advise contacting your vet. Take the product packaging with you, so that your vet can see what you have been using. Like humans, some animals have sensitivities to medications which are not evident until they take them for the first time. If you find one type of treatment is unsuitable for your own pet, Beaphar has a extensive range of worming solutions which offer you an alternative.'`
